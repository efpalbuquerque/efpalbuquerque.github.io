# Intellect Network

People are connected according to the ideas that they espouse, the content they consume, the people they list are their influences

Good: Brings attention to the practice of identifying one's non-fictional heroes. (could influences also be fictional? Why not?)

Issue: propagating eco chamber

# Gratitude Network

Creates a space where recognition of the help received by others is encouraged.
