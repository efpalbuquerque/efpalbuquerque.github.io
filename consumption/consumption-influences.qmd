I have been influenced by many people throughout my life, and my gratitude to them knows no bounds, especially to those whom I've met personally and who devoted their time to my growth. I have been lucky.

 In this page, however, I want to share with you some influences that are available to all, and directions to some of the content that I have found to be persuasive and growth inducing, at least for a while.

# Feynman

Curiosity and the pleasure of intellectual pursuit

# Wolfram

The creation of something new and the advocacy for mathematical literacy

# J. S. Mill

General scholarship, being unashamedly ahead of his time (esp. with regards to feminism), utilitarianism as an approach to ethics.

# Nietzsche

Fearless attack of institutions, depth of insight, promotion of human development.
