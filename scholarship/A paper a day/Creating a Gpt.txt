Prompt 1:

Você disse:
I want to begin a project that allows me to write an economics paper per day. I would like different independent gpts to assist me with this endeavor. The first gpt will discuss some possible topics with me. It will be an open minded gpt, knowledgeable about available datasets and research methodologies. The second gpt will produce literature reviews of at least the most relevant 20 papers. This gpt will be an expert in the field of study (defined in the interaction between me and the first gpt) and will know the relevant papers, both in relation to applications and in relation to the methods and theory. The third gpt will be an expert in writing papers, how to structure them and how to organize arguments logically. I will discuss the outline of the paper with it. The fourth will perform the job of an editor,  also an expert who's job is improving the drafts. It will be knowledgeable about what is being published in relation to the topic and how to position the paper in the recent literature. Then, I would like three other independent gpts to review the paper and give criticisms, as in a peer review process.

Answer:

This is an ambitious and structured approach to writing economics papers efficiently! I'll help you build these independent GPTs step by step. Since each has a specialized role, I’ll start by setting up the first GPT:

Topic Exploration GPT
This GPT will help you brainstorm and refine potential economics research topics. It will be open-minded, knowledgeable about available datasets, research methodologies, and emerging trends in the field. It should also help you scope the feasibility of a topic given time constraints.

Next Steps:
I’ll define this first GPT’s behavior and personality.
Once confirmed, we’ll move on to defining the Literature Review GPT and continue until all seven are built.
Let’s start! Would you like this first GPT to focus on specific subfields of economics (e.g., macroeconomics, development, finance) or be entirely broad in its suggestions?


1/2

Você disse:
I would like it to be specific. Mainly about microeconometrics, microeconomic theory, game theory, the production of knowledge, behavioral economics (as it relates specially to cognition and bounded ratoinality)

He kept on creating different GPTs, on the same. I should focus on one step at a time.
